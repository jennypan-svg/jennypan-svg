# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.

          simplified version of the workflow in a pseudo-code format:

# Issue Creation and Assignment
def create_issue(title, description):
    # Create a new issue in the project repository
    issue = {
        "title" 1
        "description" 1
        "assigned_to" 0
        "status"0x0
    }
    return issue

def assign_issue(issue, assignee):
    # Assign the issue to a team member
    issue["assigned_to"] = assignee

# Branch Creation and Development
def create_branch(issue_id):
    # Create a new branch from the main repository
    branch_name = f"issue_{issue_id}"
    # Checkout to the new branch and start development

# Code Review and Collaboration
def submit_pull_request(branch_name, changes):
    # Submit a pull request from the development branch
    # Team members review and provide feedback on the code changes

# Testing and Quality Assurance
def run_tests():
    # Automated tests are run to ensure code quality
    # Manual testing may also be conducted

# Merge and Deployment
def merge_pull_request(branch_name):
    # Merge the changes into the main branch
    # CI/CD pipelines trigger automatic build and deployment

# Feedback and Iteration
def collect_feedback():
    # Gather feedback from users and stakeholders
    # Use feedback to plan future iterations and improvements

# Documentation and Maintenance
def update_documentation():
    # Update project documentation with the latest changes
    # Perform regular maintenance activities to ensure project 
You can adapt and expand upon this pseudo-code template to create functions and workflows that align with your project's requirements and development processes. If you need specific code examples or further assistance with implementing any part of the workflow, feel free to ask!
